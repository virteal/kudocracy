"Liquid democracy meets Twitter..."

Where is it running ?
---------------------

April 16 2016. It's running nowhere right now. I'm working on it.

Either connect to http://kudocracy.com or send a "login" direct message to @Kudocracy using http://twitter.com and then follow the link in the response.


What is it?
-----------
A voting system where people can either directly approve or disapprove propositions associated to hashtags or delegate that decision.


Hashtags?
---------
Hashtags are keywords used to categorize topics in social networks.


Delegate?
---------
On matters identified by tags you specify, you can tell who votes for you when you decide not to vote directly yourself.


How is it different?
-----------

Traditional voting systems with polls every so often capture infrequent snapshots of the opinion. Because voting often on many matters is inconvenient, polls are either rare or participation suffers. Most decisions are therefore concentrated in the hands of a few representatives who may be pressured or subjected to corruption. Delegative Democracy fixes these problems thanks to modern technologies.

With Kudocracy:

* Votes are about propositions, not about candidates.

* Propositions are classified and searchable using tags.

* Delegates you choose may vote for you on subjets you choose.

* You can either follow their recommendations or vote directly.

* Votes are reversible, you can change your mind at any time.

* They are public to avoid fraud and promote transparency and open discussions.

* Results are updated in realtime, trends are visible.

* It is open source. Data are open too.


Is it available?
--------
What is available is a prototype. Depending on success, the prototype will hopefully expand into a robust system able to handle billions of votes from millions of persons. That is not trivial and requires help.


Who are you?
--------
My name is Jean-Hugues Robert, @jhr. I am a 49 years old software developper from Corsica (the island where Napoleon was born). When I found out about Delegative Democracy, I liked that. I think that it would be a good thing to apply it broadly using modern technologies, technologies that people now use all over the world.
