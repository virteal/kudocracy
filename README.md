kudocracy
=========

"Liquid democracy meets Twitter"

What is it?
-----------
An experimental voting system where people can like/dislike hashtags.


hashtags?
---------
Hashtags are keywords used to categorize topics. See also #hashtags.org.


How is it different?
-----------

Votes are reversible, you can change your mind.

Propositions are searchable using tags.

Delegates may vote for you on some propositions.

You can follow their recommendations or vote directly.

Results are updated in realtime after each vote.

You can share your votes or hide them.

It is open source.


Is it available?
--------
No, not yet. What is available is a prototype. Depending on success (vote #kudocracy!), the prototype will hopefully expand into a robust system able to handle billions of votes from millions of persons. That is not trivial and requires help.


Who are you?
--------
My name is Jean Hugues Robert, @jhr. I am a 48 years old software developper from Corsica (the island where Napoleon was born). When I discovered the Delegative democracy concept, I liked it. I think that it would be a good thing to apply it broadly, using modern technology, technology that people now use all over the world.

I hope you agree.  



There is an early prototype [here](https://github.com/JeanHuguesRobert/l8/blob/master/test/vote.js). The test UI sometimes runs [here](http://l8-c9-jhr.c9.io/?input=page%20index).

An introduction blog post (in french) is [here](http://virteal.tumblr.com/post/81729964730). A more detailed Google document is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18DAlLESgGSp4RYVu78IjzGqJEjnKOty4uOfWPHTSNFw/edit?usp=sharing). See [also](http://virteal.tumblr.com/post/85621056174)
