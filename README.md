"Liquid democracy meets Twitter"

Where is it running ?
---------------------

Either connect to http://kudocracy.com or send a "login" direct message to @Kudocracy using http://twitter.com and then follow the link in the response.

What is it?
-----------
An experimental Liquid Democracy voting system where each one of us can +1 like or -1 dislike propositions associated to hashtags, or delegate.


hashtags?
---------
Hashtags are keywords used to categorize topics. See also #hashtags.org.


Delegate?
---------
On propositions that match tags you specified, you tell who votes for you unless you vote directly.


How is it different?
-----------

Traditional voting systems with elections every so often capture infrequent snapshots of the opinion. Because voting often on many matters is inconvenient, elections are either rare or participation suffers. Most decisions are therefore concentrated in the hands of a few representatives who may be pressured or subjected to corruption. Liquid Democracy promises to solve these issues thanks to modern technologies.

With Kudocracy:

* Votes are reversible, you can change your mind.

* Propositions are searchable using tags.

* Delegates may vote for you on some propositions.

* You can follow their recommendations or vote directly.

* Votes and delegations are ephemeral and disappear unless renewed.

* Results are updated in realtime, trends are made visible.

* It is open source.


Is it available?
--------
No, not yet. What is available is a prototype. Depending on success (vote #kudocracy!), the prototype will hopefully expand into a robust system able to handle billions of votes from millions of persons. That is not trivial and requires help.


Who are you?
--------
My name is Jean Hugues Robert, @jhr. I am a 48 years old software developper from Corsica (the island where Napoleon was born). When I discovered the Delegative democracy concept, I liked it. I think that it would be a good thing to apply it broadly, using modern technology, technology that people now use all over the world.

I hope you agree. 

Jean-Hugues.
